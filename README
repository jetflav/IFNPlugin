# To Do

- rename as IFNPlugin

- name changes for any_abs, net, modulo_2, as suggested in the enum

- continued work on handling the FlavSummation, to make sure we have a nice interface

- make sure MassFlavRecombiner also gets the relevant arguments?

- integrate that in terms of the modulo_2 handling elsewhere in the code
  (so that all previous modulo_2 functionality goes into FlavRecombiner?
  Watch out if that complicates the interface and potentially retain
  the current modulo_2 arguments)
