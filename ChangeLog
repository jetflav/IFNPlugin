	* FlavInfo.hh:
	* FlavInfo.cc:

	Updated FlavInfo::flavour_of so that it throws an error on objects with
	a FlavHistory, rather than returning a flavourless FlavInfo. This mitigates
	certain user bugs

	Also updated FlavHistory::current_flavour_of and initial_flavour_of, so that they 
	no longer throw an error on jets with a FlavInfo, but instead return that FlavInfo.
