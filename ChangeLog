	* FlavNeutraliser.cc:
	* IFNPlugin.cc:
	* IFNPlugin.hh:

	Removed some of the default arguments from the old IFNPlugin
	constructor to avoid it being used by mistake. Added several
	LimitedWarnings if old (deprecated or non-tested) measures are used. 
	The description() output should now be a little more informative when 
	non-standard measures are used.

	Moved "general" measure to be first in the in the pp
	FlavNeutraliser::neutralisation_distance switch statement, since
	it is the one most likely to be used.

	* FlavInfo.hh:
	* FlavInfo.cc:

	Updated FlavInfo::flavour_of so that it throws an error on objects with
	a FlavHistory, rather than returning a flavourless FlavInfo. This mitigates
	certain user bugs.

	Also updated FlavHistory::current_flavour_of and initial_flavour_of, so that they 
	no longer throw an error on jets with a FlavInfo, but instead return that FlavInfo.

	* FlavInfo.hh:
    added FlavRecombiner::flav_summation() to enquire about the
    summation scheme that has been chosen. 

	* IFNPlugin.cc:
	* IFNPlugin.hh:

    added consistency checks between modulo_2 requests in the IFNPlugin
    constructor versus the base jet definition. Also added modulo_2 info
    in IFNPlugin description.

	* example.ref:
	updated it to reflect extra info in IFNPlugin description

	* NEWS:
	* VERSION:
